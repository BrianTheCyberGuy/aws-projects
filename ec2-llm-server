# EC2 LLM Server Setup

This project tracks the setup and configuration of an AWS EC2 instance used to eventually host a private LLM.

---

## âœ… What I Did

- Created an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2
- Chose instance type: `t2.micro` (Free Tier)
- Created key pair: `my-key.pem` (saved to my PC)
- Configured network to allow SSH from my IP only
- Launched the instance successfully

---

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Connect to the EC2 instance from my Windows computer
- Install Docker, Python, and required LLM tools
- Upload or pull LLM model files (Meta LLaMA or similar)
- Expose an API to interact with the model
